# ShaderTutorial
This is one of the tutorials that served as the practicals, for the real time 3D techniques for games modules. This one specifically involved the use of a shader to load in the data of multiple textures for the plane that had been loaded in. Then using a shadow map it sampled the textures and created a shadow for the loaded plane model.
