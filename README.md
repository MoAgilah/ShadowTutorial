# ShaderTutorial
This is one of the tutorials that served as the practicals, for the real time 3D techniques for games modules. This one specifically involved the use of a shader to load in the data of multiple textures for the heightmap that had been loaded in the heightmap tutorial. Then using a colour map it sampled the textures and created a shaded height map, giving a more realistic view based on the colour map provided.
