# ShaderTutorial
This is one of the tutorials that served as the practicals, for the real time 3D techniques for games modules. This one involved the use of a shader to load in the data of multiple textures for the heightmap that has been loaded. Then using a colour map it sampled the textures and created a shaded height map.
